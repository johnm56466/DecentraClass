- Launch of a decentralized course marketplace
- Access control for public/private course materials
- Basic reputation system for students and educators
- Content versioning and edit history
- Expanded testing with pilot institutions

## Phase 3: Decentralized Education Ecosystem
- DAO-managed certification and moderation tools
- Protocol documentation for external integrations
- Third-party API access to student record data
- Interoperability with DAO tools, coding bootcamps, and employer verifications
- Full mainnet launch with staking-based incentives
