# DecentraClass

DecentraClass is a decentralized learning management system (LMS) powered by Xandeum. It enables users to store, access, and manage educational content—lessons, assignments, grades, and credentials—on-chain using Xandeum’s read/write storage layer.

## Vision
Empower students, educators, and institutions with ownership, permanence, and trust in their academic records.

## Features
- Wallet-based identity authentication
- Decentralized course creation and delivery
- Immutable grading and assignment submission
- On-chain diplomas and certificates
- Public/private course permissioning

## MVP Roadmap
**Phase 1:** Course creation, submission, grading dashboard

**Phase 2:** Credential NFTs, marketplace

**Phase 3:** DAO-linked education tracks and protocol integrations
